Problem Statement

Small food stalls or beginner-level digital restaurant systems often lack a simple way to take and manage customer orders. Manual order-taking can lead to calculation mistakes, confusion about item availability, and delays in service. A basic automated program is needed that helps the restaurant take orders, check item availability, and calculate the total bill quickly and accurately.

Scope of the Project

* Build a simple command-line based restaurant ordering system.
* Display a list of available food items with their prices.
* Allow users to select menu items and automatically calculate the total bill.
* Validate the availability of items from a predefined menu.
* Provide an option for customers to add multiple items to their order.
* Ensure accurate billing based on menu pricing.

Target Users

* Small restaurants, cafés, or food stalls that need a lightweight billing tool.
* Beginners learning Python who want to understand menu-based programs.
* Students creating mini-projects for practical Python exposure.
* Anyone who needs a basic order-taking system without advanced features.

High-Level Features

* Static Menu Display: Shows all available food items and their respective prices.
* Order Validation: Checks if the ordered item exists in the menu.
* Multiple Item Support: Allows customers to add more than one item.
* Automated Billing: Calculates total cost based on selected menu items.
* User-Friendly Interaction: Simple input prompts and clear output messages.
